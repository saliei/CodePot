### Calculalting the MLUPs, when move and hydrovar fused. currently we do it with `hydrovar_soa`.

### Same problem in `mlups-KNL-1MPI-256THREADS.dat`.

### Calculating the efficiency with `mlups` or `avg call` time.

### overlapping `pbc` on left and right halos with bulk `move` and `collide`.

### strog and weak scaling graphs should be in AVGxCall, it can't be in MLUPs.
